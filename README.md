Xupply is a web application that connects those who NEED supplies with those who HAVE supplies and allows financiers to fund those who NEED supplies.

There are 3 users. “Retailers”, “Manufacturers” & “Financiers”.

**Retailers** create requests with items and the quantities.

**Financiers** fund the requests with a total budget. Requests can be funded at any time in the process to allow for speed.

**Manufacturers** create orders based on the requests. They also create the Items retailers can request to avoid duplicate items.

### Soon...

**Payments:** Requests are funded through the XRP blockchain. This allows us to create payment channels. Then as the order goes through the process, the financier can distribute the funds. Ex. After the order is created, the financier can release a portion of the funds, then later when the product is shipped, the financier can release the remaining funds. This can be done in any numbers of steps with any amount each time.

**Logistics:** We are connected with JB Hunt and Amazon working on 3rd party api integration to facilitate the shipment process into the application.

**Suppliers:** We do also want to add “suppliers” and allow the manufacturers to request supplies from them. Much like a retailer would a manufacturer.
